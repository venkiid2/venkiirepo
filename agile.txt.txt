  Q1: What is Agile?

   Agile is a methodology which follows set of principles to deliver 
   Continuios and Quick working software to clients

  Q2: What are the Agile principles?
  
     1. Contious delivery of working software in multiple iterations
     2. Each iteration short cycle..couple of weeks than months
     3. Team work in each iteration analysis/design/development/Testing/deploy
     4. more coolobrative with Business people to encourage changes and to get
           continous feedback
     5. Self organizing and cross functional team members
     6. Agile gives more preference to discussion(Face to face) than documentation
     7. Agile measure progress based on working software not based on documentation

   
  Q3:  What are the advantageous of delivering project in AGile when compared to
     Traditional?

       1.  Requirement changes are allowed 
       2.  Early software(Ontime delivery)
       3.  Early customer feedback
       4.  more colloboration between team members

 Q4: What are the major challenges for Agile projects?

     4.1 Client colloboration
     4.2 Team members mindset
     4.3 Automation skills

 Q5: What kind of projects are best suitable for Agile?

        5.1 Client is not having clear requirements( Longterm/Complex/ongoing)
        5.2 New technology
        5.3 if cliennt is expecting software or ealy feedback
       
 2008-->Satyam computers-->Insurance project-->US client-->2007 mid-->2010
          2008 end-->4 months

     1. Requirement changes-->6 months 
     2. 6 more 

  3 years--> 1 yera

 2009 April -->Release 1 or Iteration 1
 2009 May--> Release 2
      

 Q6: What are the problems in Traditional model or 
       sequential approach or waterfall mode?
     
   1. High resistance to change Requirements
   2. High risk projects, client has to wait till last day of the project
           to give feedback on working software
   3. No easrly customerfeedback..
   4. No colloborative between team members
   5. CI/CT/CD/CF not available like agile

 Q7: what are the skills required to work in Agile projects?

     1. Cross Functional 
     2. Self organizing

 Q8: What are the disadvantageous of Agile?
      
    8.1 Too many depedencies (People/Projects) 
    8.2 Rigid
    8.3 client is not actively participating

  Agile Principles
        Framework
        Tools    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Scrum Framework?


 Agile Methodology-->Scrum Framework

 To implement Agile principles to reality

   Agile practice


   Scrum is Agile practice where 3-8 IT engineers work colloborativerly
  for 2 to 4 weeks to deliver working software freqnetly and continously as
   customr priority/Product Owner priority/Busines prioroity

 Extreme programming is Agile practice where 2-5 developers work to deliver
  working software every 1-3 days as per  features priorotized by developer


1.   Scrum-->New project
2.   Kanban-->Support or maintenance
3.   AGILE SAFE-->Enterprise
